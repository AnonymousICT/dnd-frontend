    <p>Dungeons and Dragons is one of my favorite games in my life. But it's not beginner friendly... at all.</p>
    <p>To lower the barrier of entry to this game, I made this app with the intention for newer players to get into the storytelling aspect faster</p>
    <p>This web app is designed to streamline the most difficult part of Dungeons and Dragons for new and experienced players</p>
    <p>This current version does not have multi-classing as an option.</p>
